# NOTE:
# - in Debian Stretch and later libpolarssl-dev has been renamed to libmbedtls-dev
# - list of packages that will be build by kdesrc-build: libkomparediff2-dev libgrantlee-dev
# - python-docutils is for rst2html command used by kdevelop for (better) documentation display
# - Debian Stretch packages libcv-dev, libcvaux-dev and libhighgui-dev have been replaced by libopencv-dev in Debian Sid
# - transitional package plasma-framework-dev (depends on libkf5plasma-dev) has been removed from sid
# - libkf5kface-dev depends on libkf5kface10.0.0 which in sid is build against old opencv packages that 
#   have already been removed from repository. Thus instead of depending on "libkf5.*-dev" we ignore
#   libkf5kface-dev by use of a posix regular expression.
# - libnm-glib-dev, libnm-glib-vpn-dev and libnm-util-dev are deprecated since network-manager 1.12.0-4
# - Qt4, kde-l10n-de and kde-sc-dev-latest are not available in Debian 11 (Bullseye) and later
